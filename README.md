# 3D-Industry-and-Problem-Solving
These are the slides for the talk I gave to the students of the Computer Science Department of AUTh. \
It can be broken down into two main parts.

In the first part I attempted to shortly explain the 3D industry and a Programmers role in it with a focus in Game Development.

In the second and most important part I introduced some real game-dev problem cases, reduced to a basic level, \
in order to explain the problem solving approach expected by a games programmer (applies in 3D in general for the most part).

If you have any feedback or recommendations to improve this presentation, especially the second part, please let me know \
